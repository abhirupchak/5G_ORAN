**Difference between Distributed RAN and Centralized RAN**

In DRAN all basestation have a BBU alloted to them(expensive backhaul-from Core network to BBU) thus fronthaul(from BBU to antenna) becomes easy.
In CRAN there is a centralized BBU near the Core network server for a group of basestations thus fronthaul is expensive(since we need to setup long distances of expensive optical fibre cabling).]

There is a notable advantage for CRAN, that is, if there more load on one basestation, more BBUs can be alloted to it at any point unlike in DRAN.

**Difference between Centralized & Cloud RAN**

They are similar since BBUs are setup near core network in both cases. It is just that in cloud RAN the NFs run on cloud services instead of COTS servers.
The NFs running on software instead of hardware on either cloud or COTS serversare called Virtual NFs.

**Splitting of BBU**

3GPP in its recommendation 38.801 created a split of functions in the BBU dividing them into Centralized Unit and Distributed unit. The link between these two units is called midhaul.

This splitting is also called Horizontal Disaggregation.

The BBU has the following functions as per the OSI layer.

These need to be distributed in the DU and CU in an optimal way.
