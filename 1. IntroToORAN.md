**Components of a 5G network**

1. UE
2. RAN(GNB) - This is what we will focus on in this course
3. Core Network - all core network components.

**Design Goals OF Open-RAN**

Mainly ORAN means being able to use mean open and standard components for building a GNB. Thus reducing vendor lock problems and promoting interoperability of components from different vendors.

## Evolution towards ORAN

**Traditional Basestation Architecture**

Used in 2G,3G,4G this consists of BBU which processes signal recieved from Core network.

Radio Unit which modulates the basedband signal from BBU to carrier frequency and sends it through a RF cable to the antennas from transmission.

**Evolution to the Contemporary Basestation**

In order to solve power loss problem, contempary basestations were developed.
These used optical fibre cabling which has lesser power loss than RF but the problem of vendor lock still persisted(propietary).

**Evolution to Virtualized-RAN**

This introduced the concept of separating hardware and software.
Here the backhaul has been converted to a virtual format, with BBUs running on COTS servers. Note that this was called VRAN and not virtualized basestation, this is because the
software from many different basestations could be run on the same COTS server.

RRU hardware is still propietary so not ORAN. Only BBU functions running on COTS.
The concept of NFV is applied here.

**Towards ORAN**

Instead of RRU we now had software defined radio on COTS hardware and the interface b/w BBU and RRU is also now an open interface, i.e. propietary hardware was not used.
